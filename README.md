# Autonomous_driving_Control_design

This project is used to design a controller of an autonomous driving vehicle with predefined waypoints and velocity profile using Carla Simulator.

This project is part of final assignment for Intrduction to Self-Driving Cars on coursera. 
As part of control process, longitudinal speed is controlled using PID control and lateral steering control is done using Stanley Control.
